1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,000
不是吧
Come on!

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,120
你是鹰眼
You're Hawkeye!

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,540
前情提要

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,540
我爱你 爸爸
I love you, Dad.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,250
我更爱你
I love you more.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,330
到家给我打电话 我爱你们
Call me when you get home? I love you.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,500
阿曼德·杜凯恩 昨晚在他的住所被发现遇害
Armand Duquesne was found dead in his home last night.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,950
-对 -这两起事件让警方怀疑
-Yeah. -These two events have officials wondering

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,790
浪人是否真的回到了纽约 以及他下一步会做什么
if indeed, the Ronin has returned to New York City and what he may do next.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,080
杰克在掩饰什么 妈妈
Jack is hiding something, Mom.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,950
你不觉得有点奇怪吗  他叔叔威胁你 然后当晚
Don't you think it's a little strange that the same night his uncle threatens you,

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,370
就死于剑伤 
he ends up murdered by sword?

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,540
-凯特·毕肖普穿衣服装扮成男的 -你们到底在说谁 
-Kate Bishop is guy in costume. -Who are you talking about?

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,700
我们抓住他们了…
We have them...

15
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,620
听我说
And listen.

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,950
2007年

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,120
嘿
Hey!

18
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,700
翻到课本…

19
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,410
词汇…

20
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,790
玛雅…翻译

21
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,080
注意…

22
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,830
天空会发出什么声音

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,040
天空和你一样安静
It's quiet like you.

24
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,290
龙会发出什么声音

25
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,330
真的有龙吗

26
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,410
没有 也许有吧
Um, no. Maybe they are,

27
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,160
但是龙生活在另一个世界里
but dragons live in a different world.

28
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,450
如果它们找到了

29
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,040
进入咱们世界的方法了呢

30
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,620
那它们会变得更强大
Well, that would make them stronger.

31
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
我以为学校里的孩子

32
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,250
都和我一样

33
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,120
当然不是
It's impossible.

34
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,790
知道吗 你是独一无二的
See, you are one of a kind.

35
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,450
但是你说过

36
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,660
我们能上得起聋哑学校

37
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,750
对不起
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,830
但是最后你会发现 这里更适合你
But in the end, it'll be better for you.

39
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,250
我是不是不能用手语了

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,330
不会
No.

41
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,950
你得学会在两个世界里生活
You have to learn to jump between two worlds.

42
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,910
怎么生活

43
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,040
要善于观察
Just by watching.

44
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,830
好的 同学们 休息一下
All right, class. Water break.

45
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,450
今天在学校好好表现
Hey, be good in class today.

46
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,040
但是记住 在比赛里 速度比体格更重要
But remember, for your match, it's more about speed than size.

47
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,000
放学后叔叔会来接你
Uncle will take you home after class.

48
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,450
晚上见
I'll see you tonight.

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,910
好的 爸爸

50
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,540
玛雅 该你上场了
Maya, you're up.

51
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,370
行礼
And bow.

52
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,120
准备好了吗 
Ready?

53
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,120
开始
Fight!

54
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,120
快跑吧

55
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,450
我不会抛下你的

56
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,000
我已经不行了

57
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,160
展翅高飞吧…

58
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,830
我的小龙

59
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:53,000
《鹰眼》

60
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,700
你跟个小马似的 鹰眼
You're like a pony, Hawkeye.

61
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,250
K.B.玩具店 歇业大甩卖 最后几天

62
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,870
继续骑呀 真好玩
Just keep going, and going, and going. I love it.

63
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,080
真好玩 哥们 看看鹰眼这家伙
I love it, bro. Look at Hawkeye!

64
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,660
-你的箭怎么没用了  -嗖
Where's your arrows now? Pew, pew.

65
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,290
猛男鹰眼骑了匹小马驹
Big, strong Hawkeye riding prony.

66
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,540
他们应该再开心点才对啊 我们都觉得挺好玩的
They should smile more. This is fun for us too, you know.

67
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,950
-再来一次 恩里克 再来 快 -好吧
Again. Enrique, again, come on. -Great.

68
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,080
-再拿点硬币来 -是啊
Go get more quarters. -Yes.

69
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,620
太无聊了 迪米特里 咱们打牌吧
This is boring. Dmitri, let's play cards.

70
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,500
看来你在生我的气
Seems like you're mad at me.

71
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,330
我知道可能你不这么觉得
I know it doesn't look like that,

72
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,500
但是没有我你就完蛋了 你知道吗 
but you'd be lost without me, you realize that?

73
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,250
我正要帮你洗脱罪名
I was about to clear your name from the suit,

74
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,120
结果你突然从天而降
until you decided to crash through the skylight.

75
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,790
是啊
Yeah.

76
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,750
-哥们 -冷静 哥们 冷静
-Bro! -Cálmate, bro. Cálmate.

77
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,410
你没事吧 
You good?

78
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,250
我给女朋友买了梦龙乐队的票
I buy Imagine Dragons tickets for my girlfriend,

79
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,000
作为提前的圣诞节礼物 好吗 
as, like, early Christmas gift, right?

80
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,450
-挺贴心的嘛 -是啊 多贴心啊
That's so sweet. -Good, sweet.

81
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,250
然后我们吵了一架 你猜她说什么 
Then we had fight. You know what she said?

82
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,160
她说既然这个票是礼物 她想和她妹妹一起去
She said that the tickets were gift, so she wants to bring her sister.

83
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,790
往好处想
I mean, look on the bright side.

84
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,000
你不用去看梦龙乐队了
You don't have to go see Imagine Dragons.

85
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,160
我喜欢梦龙乐队
I love Imagine Dragons.

86
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,830
她其实不喜欢 她这么做就是为了伤害我
Uh, she doesn't even like them, you know. She did this on purpose to hurt me.

87
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,200
我觉得你们彼此都应该道歉
Look, I think you both owe apologies.

88
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,620
告诉她她伤害了你的感情
Tell her she hurt your feelings,

89
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,370
但是要向她道歉 你拿这个冒充给她的礼物
but apologize for pretending that that was a gift for her.

90
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,040
好吧 等等 我找支笔 等一下 好吗 等会见
Okay, wait, I need a pen. Just... Okay, okay? See you.

91
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,200
看 一点点信任
See? A little trust,

92
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,410
加上一点点沟通和倾听
a little communicating, a little listening...

93
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,120
-你说什么  -这就是人之常情啊
What? Basic human stuff.

94
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,580
-你听我说 -先听我说
-You know what I think? -You know what I think?

95
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,620
我觉得你话太多了
I think you talk too much.

96
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,290
她总是这样吗 
She always like this?

97
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
我应该割开你的喉咙
Maybe I rip out your throat.

98
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,910
要不让她来
Or maybe she will.

99
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,950
她是谁 
Who is she?

100
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,410
谢谢你
Thank you.

101
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,750
好吧 对不起
Oh, uh, yeah. Sorry.

102
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,040
我的听觉有问题 但是不聋
Hard of hearing, not deaf.

103
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,870
天啊
Oh, boy.

104
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,700
再来点饼干 谢谢
More cookie, please. Thank you.

105
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,330
好吧 很高兴和你交谈
Right, well, it's nice talking to you.

106
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,080
她问你来这干什么 克林特·巴顿
She asked what you're doing here, Clint Barton.

107
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,330
-我来骑独角兽 -他来学习信任
-Riding a unicorn. -Learning about trust.

108
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,700
〝你太依赖科技了〟
"You rely too much on technology."

109
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,870
我的常用武器是两根棍一根弦 所以…
Well, my go-to weapon is two sticks and a string, so...

110
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,200
不 她说的是你的助听器
No, she means your hearing aid. Ah.

111
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,950
〝不用那个 你反而会更好〟
"You might find you're better off without it."

112
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,040
对 有时候我也这么想
Yeah, sometimes I think that very same thing.

113
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,910
现在说说那件战服吧
Now, the suit.

114
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,700
她是碰巧穿上的
She put it on by accident.

115
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,660
她不知道那件战服意味着什么
She didn't know what it means.

116
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,120
她不是浪人
She's not Ronin.

117
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,080
看看她 就是个小孩
Look at her. She's nine.

118
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,330
被惯坏了的小孩
And spoiled rotten.

119
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,330
〝她把我的几个手下揍了一顿〟
"She beat up a few of my guys

120
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,750
〝在你身处险境的时候挺身而出〟
"and then came running when you were in trouble.

121
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,910
〝看来她和那件战服有点关系〟
"Seems like she's got something to do with it.

122
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,160
〝就算她不是浪人 也不能说明浪人没有回来〟
"And just because she's not the Ronin doesn't mean that Ronin's not back."

123
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,200
那就是个谣传
That's just a rumor.

124
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,830
〝你怎么知道的 〟
"How do you know?"

125
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,080
因为他死了
Because he's dead.

126
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,660
〝那是谁杀的他 〟
"So, who got him, then?"

127
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,910
黑寡妇

128
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,040
〝所以浪人已经死了 杀掉他的人也已经死了〟
"So Ronin is dead, and the person who killed him is dead.

129
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
〝死无对证啊 你怎么知道的 〟
"That's convenient. How do you know this?"

130
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,500
〝因为我在场〟
'Cause I was there.

131
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,040
〝你在说谎〟
"You're lying."

132
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,620
好吧 这样下去不行
Okay, clearly this isn't working. Um...

133
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,790
如果你和这件事没关系
If you have nothing to do with this,

134
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,500
那你为什么要穿上那件战服 
then why did you put on this suit in the first place?

135
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,450
玛雅 别这样
Maya, no.

136
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,910
天啊 我穿那件战服是因为
Oh, God. I put that suit on because I didn't want

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,120
我不想让任何人知道我在拍卖会 好吗 
anybody to know that I was at the auction, okay?

138
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,540
我穿的时候根本不知道那是什么 我发誓
I didn't know what it was when I put it on, I swear.

139
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,410
我发誓
I swear.

140
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,500
你要干什么 
-What are you doing?

141
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,040
-这不重要 好吗  -听我说
Doesn't matter, okay? -BARTON: Listen to me.

142
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,330
听着 现在不是害怕的时候
Listen. No, now's not the time to be scared.

143
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,660
咱们会逃出去的

You go back to living your life, I'll go back to my family.

145
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,250
现在你得胆大妄为一点 好吗 
You're gonna harness that over-confidence of yours, okay?

146
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,620
那种目空一切的胆大妄为 还记得吗 
This ridiculous over-confidence, you remember that one?

Don't shoot! They want him alive, you idiot!

158
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,750
你别想跑
You're not going anywhere.

159
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,700
我打得过
I was doing fine.

160
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,250

我们得找辆车
We need a car.

165
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,250

What do you mean, we're... Oh, my God, trick arrows?

185
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,040
绝对不能用这个…
Definitely not this one...

186
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,160
-没必要这么绝对吧 -这个也不行
-Don't say definitely like that. -Not this one.

187
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,000
-这个太危险了 -这个行吗 
-This is too dangerous. -This one fine?

188

-我要用这个 -一定要小心
-I'm using this one. -Hey, be careful.

00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,870
-我天生就很小心 -这可不是普通的箭头
-I was born careful. -They're not regular arrows.

-开雨刷器 -快点

196

我什么都看不见了
Ugh! I can't see nothing!

197
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,580
用油灰箭射他们的车轮
Hit their wheels with the putty arrow.

198
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,120
好主意 你给箭贴上标签 我就照做
Oh. Great idea. I'll do that as soon as you label these damn things.

199
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,950
要想方便点咱们最好调…
This'd be a lot easier if we were facing...

200
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,000
要想方便点咱们最好调个头
It'd be easier if we were facing the other way.

201

还有四种箭比这支更危险 
There are four arrows more dangerous than that one?

205
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,790
搋子箭 干什么用的  完全没用吗 
A plunger arrow? What is the trick? That it's completely useless?

206
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,500
-小心 -看着点路 白痴
-Look out! -Watch it, moron!

207
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,750
圣诞快乐

208
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,540
一定要有用
Please be a good one. Please be a good one.

209
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,910
那支箭叫什么 
What the hell is that one called?

210
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,330
对不住了 圣诞老人
-Sorry, Santa.

211
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,500

216
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,580
古董车还是被毁了
And the Challenger gets totaled anyway.

217
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,750
现在我什么都看不见了 谢谢
Now I really can't see. Thank you.

218
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,580
等等 坐稳了
-Wait. Hang on, hang on.

219
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,870
他想干什么 
What is he doing?

220
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,620
他要直接撞过来
He's gonna crash into us.

221
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,410
用这个 干掉那辆卡车
Here, take out that truck.

222
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,410
往高处瞄
Aim high.

223
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,040
让箭在下落时击中他
Bring the arrow down on him.

224
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,580
咱们怎么办 这就是支普通箭
What's the plan? This is just a normal arrow.

225
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,290
我不知道你在说什么 我就假设你同意了
I have no idea what you're saying, just gonna assume you're on board.

226
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,160

拿着 掩护我
Take this. Cover me.

232
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,040
USB箭 这玩意有什么用 
A USB arrow? What am I supposed to do with this?

233
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,580
天啊 他得有个接口 这支箭才能派上用场
God, I hope he's got a dongle arrow to make this useful.

234
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,040
别动
Don't move!

235
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,700
否则就让你们尝尝这支箭的厉害
You do not wanna see what this arrow does!

236
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,160
相信我
Trust me.

237
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,790
跟我来
Follow me.

238
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,290
该死 快去追
Damn it. Come on, let's go!

239
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,120
现在我明白搋子箭是干什么的了
Now I get the whole plunger arrow thing.

240
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,790
咱们还得遛狗呢
Oh, we gotta walk the dog.

241
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,450
你没说错…
You're not wrong...

242
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,330
它一整天都被关在屋子里
He's been cooped up all day.

243
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,160
我不太确定狗能忍受多长时间…
Not quite sure how long a dog can--

244
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,700
你真是全世界最厉害的弓箭手之一
...call yourself one of the world's greatest archers.

245
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,950
天啊 你真的这么想吗 
Oh, my God, do you really think so?

246
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,290
我都不知道面对这种压力我该怎么办了
I wasn't sure how I'd do under all that pressure...

247
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,080
咱们得去遛狗吧 是不是 
Probably should walk the dog. Don't you think?

248
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,910
都关了一整天了
-Been cooped up all day.

249
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,080
克林特

Hey, listen, I can't really talk right now,

252
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,370
因为看来…也许…

253
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,750
你方便发信息吗 你能打字吗

256
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,620

你要不去吃点早饭
Why don't you go get some breakfast

268
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,830
然后找本书看看 等妈妈起床呢 
and read a book or somethin' till Mama wakes up?

269
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,790
读书有什么意义啊 
What's the point of even reading a book?

270
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,410
你今天晚上能回家吗  圣诞电影马拉松可要开始了

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,450
如果你不能回家过圣诞节 也没关系 爸爸
It's okay if you can't come home for Christmas, Daddy.

282
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,040
我们能理解
We understand.

283
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,790
孩子 我…我和你说 我非常想念你们
Oh, boy, I'm... I tell you, I miss you so much.

284
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,000
他说你不能回家过圣诞节也没关系

285
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,450
我会回去的 孩子
Um, I'm gonna be there, buddy.

286
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,200
我…我说回去 就一定回去 好吗 
I... You know I'm gonna be there, like I said, right?

287
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,790
听到你的声音我太开心了
Um, I'm so happy to hear your voice.

288
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,250
爸爸要挂了 好吗 
Daddy's gotta go, okay?

289
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,910
我爱你
I love you.

290
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,120
爱你 爸爸
Love you, Daddy.

291
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,500
我更爱你
I love you more.

292
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,160
再见
Bye-bye.

293
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,000
谢谢
Thank you.

294
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,330
没事
Yeah.

295
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,540
小心点 正面朝上
Careful with it. Up top.

296
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,660
我都开始习惯这个地方了
I was just getting used to this place, you know.

297
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,330
是啊 现在这里不安全了
Yeah, well, now it's compromised.

298
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,830
我们几分钟以后就能搬完

299
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,830
嘿
Hey. Hey.

300
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
我想跟你谈谈

301
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,000
现在可以吗

302
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,910
这些笨蛋一天的时间

303
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,660
根本学不会手语

304
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,290
好吧 咱们谈谈

305
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,950
今天早上情况有些失控

306
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
你知道这有多危险吧

307
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,950
如果我们要继续追踪浪人…

308
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,870
我们就得尽量保持低调

309
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,410
希望叔叔不会发现

310
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,580
不
No.

311
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,160
他会很生气的

312
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,700
换成是我父亲

313
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,290
你也会这么质问他吗

314
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,040
你父亲永远把大家放在首位

315
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,500
那我问你 现在是谁说了算

316
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,250
你说了算

317
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,500
没错

318
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,660
继续调查克林特·巴顿

319
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,080
发信人：凯特 怪不得你叫鹰眼 而不是鹰耳

320
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,330
屏蔽 删除
Block. Delete.

321
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,700
早上好
Morning.

322
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,500
你们在等谁 
What are you waiting for?

323
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,910
等你 你是医生吧 
Uh, you. You're the doctor, right?

324
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
我很忙
I'm very busy.

325
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,580
我真的需要把这个修好
Oh. Well... Really need this fixed.

326
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,000
拜托了 
Please?

327
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,450
我需要五分钟 只收现金
Give me five minutes. Cash only.

328
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,040
谢谢
Thank you.

329
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,450
我跟你说了 肯定修得好
Told you we'd get it fixed.

330
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,250
但是最棒的是…
What was most amazing though...

331
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,330
那场战斗已经够疯狂了 但是比它还要厉害的
Better than anything we did in the middle of that crazy battle.

332
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,080
就是那个小…
That little...

333
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,500
就是…
-Was that...

334
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,000
刚才一直都不正常吗 
Was that out the whole time?

335
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,790
我能再来点咖啡吗 
Can I get more coffee, please?

336
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,200
当然没问题
Yeah, sure.

337
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,200
谢谢
Thank you.

338
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,540
我知道听起来有点怪异
Look, I know this may sound weird,

339
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,330
但是这可是我一直以来的梦想
but I've dreamed of this for as long as I can remember.

340
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,540
我爸爸非常勇敢
My dad was fearless.

341
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,330
他的一生都在帮助人们
And his whole life was about helping people.

342
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,040
穿上那件战服的时候 我觉得〝这就对了〟
When I put that suit on, I thought, "This is it.

343
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,910
〝在那一刻 我成为了我想成为的人〟
"This is the moment I become who I'm supposed to be."

344
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,160
我记得我曾经有过同样的想法
I remember the day I thought the same thing.

345
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:30,950
可是 那…那是有代价的
You know, it's, uh... It comes with a price.

346
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,830
什么有代价 
What does?

347
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,290
你想要的生活
This life you wanna live.

348
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,870
真的去帮助其他人
To really help people.

349
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,910
我的意思是 你努力试着去帮助人们
I mean, try to help people, anyway.

350
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,830
就会有很多牺牲
Comes with a lot of sacrifices.

351
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,160
你会永远地失去一些东西
And some things you'll lose... forever.

352
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,950
也肯定会得到一些东西
Well, there's also things you gain,

353
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,580
比如各种特殊箭头和炫酷的战服
like trick arrows and a cool costume.

354
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,500
说到这个
Speaking of which.

355
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,660
我一直在考虑你的人设问题
I've been thinking about your branding issue.

356
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,330
你需要一件更有辨识度的战服
You need a more recognizable costume.

357
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,870
你知道过去二十年我的工作
Uh, you realize that my job for the last 20 years

358
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,540
都是不能被人注意到的吗 
was to be not recognizable, right?

359
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,410
那你算是彻底失败了
Well, you've officially failed at that.

360
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,080
想象一下这件衣服…紫色的
Picture this... in purple.

361
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,500
-他头上是什么  -那就是你的头
-What's that on his head? -It's your head.

362
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,870
翅膀 像鹰一样
Uh, wings. Like a hawk.

363
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:34,250
在你的额头上有个〝H〟 代表着〝鹰眼〟
That's an "H" that's on your forehead. That's... for "Hawkeye."

364
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,950
绝对不行
Well, not happening.

365
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,370
好吧…
Okay. Um...

366
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,370
如果要是全黑的呢  全黑的服装再加个面具 
What if it was all black? All black with a mask?

367
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,000
或者兜帽 
Maybe a hood?

368
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,410
你不能告诉我浪人的身份
You can't say who Ronin is

369
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,120
因为他是和你很亲近的人 对吗 
because it's someone close to you, isn't it?

370
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,700
你必须要保守秘密
It's your job to keep their secret.

371
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,620
我不穿这种招摇的战服 原因如下
There are several reasons why I'd never wear a flashy costume.

372
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,620
首先 我的工作要求我保持隐匿
My job is to be, number one, a ghost.

373
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,660
其次 如果穿成这样 我妻子非和我离婚不可
Number two, my wife would divorce me if I put something like this on.

374
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,910
再次…
And number three, uh...

375
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,580
我不是个好的榜样
I'm not a role model.

376
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,790
抱歉 凯特 我不配做任何人的榜样
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm not a role model to anyone.

377
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,750
从来都不配
Never have been.

378
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,000
你说什么 你就是啊
What? Yes, you are.

379
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,250
你就是 你…你来到这里
You are. You... You came here.

380
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,330
你在圣诞节离开了自己的家人
You left your family at Christmas

381
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,160
因为你觉得陌生人可能会受到伤害
because you thought some stranger was gonna get hurt.

382
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,160
即便我搞砸了 你也没一走了之
You stuck around even though I screwed up.

383
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,580
现在你遇到困难了
And now you're stuck.

384
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,450
不管你愿不愿意
Whether you like it or not,

385
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,950
运动服黑帮认定咱们和浪人有关系了
the Tracksuits have connected us both to Ronin,

386
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,910
而且很明显他们不打算善罢甘休
and it's pretty clear they're not just gonna drop this.

387
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,830
好吧 这一点你倒是没说错
Well, that you are not wrong about.

388
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,040
更不用说我妈可能要嫁给一个杀人犯
Not to mention the fact that my mom might be marrying a murderer.

389
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,790
还有这个
And then there's that.

390
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,830
在我看来 咱们是一条绳上的蚂蚱
As far as I'm concerned, we're in this together.

391
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,620
你得帮我付账 我妈把我的信用卡注销了
I'm gonna need you to get that. My mom canceled my credit card.

392
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,500
-没问题 我来 -谢谢
-Yeah, I got it. -Thank you.

393
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,410
好吧 我说…
All right. And look...

394
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,120
你得给这条狗起个名
You're gonna have to name this dog, you know.

395
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,410
当然
Sure.

396
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,830
小凯撒 
Little Ol' Caesar?

397
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,450
黑狗党 
Dogfather?

398
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,000
披萨狗爵士 
Sir Dog of Pizza?

399
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,790
披萨狗 
Pizza Dog?

400
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,580
好吧 搭档 咱们开始吧
All right, partner, let's get into it.

401
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,620
你有没有注意到玛雅和那个小帅哥 关系有点紧张 还是我太敏感了 
You pick up on any tension between Maya and the hot guy, or was it just me?

402
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,120
他的名字叫卡齐
His name's Kazi.

403
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,950
好吧 所以我猜这些穿运动服的家伙 肯定惹上了什么麻烦 
All right, so I take it these Tracksuit guys are into some pretty bad stuff?

404
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,910
对 惹麻烦了
Yeah, bad stuff.

405
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,120
能具体说说吗 
You care to elaborate?

406
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,370
我不想说
Not really.

407
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
他们一开始势力很小 然后慢慢发展起来了
They started small, but grew.

408
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,790
至少他们的老大 为了壮大组织不择手段
Or at least the guy at the top, he'll do anything to grow the operation.

409
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,910
我以为玛雅就是老大
I thought Maya was the boss.

410
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,040
不是 她上面还有人
No, there's someone above Maya.

411
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,830
那人你可惹不起
Someone you don't wanna mess with.

412
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,200
他们肯定和浪人结下了血海深仇 对吗 
There's obviously bad blood with Ronin, right?

413
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,120
是的
Yeah.

414
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,620
浪人消灭了另一边的供应商 然后干掉了运动服黑帮的高层
Ronin hit the supplier on the other side and then hit Tracksuit upper management.

415
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,200
看来故事不少啊
Sounds like a lot of drama.

416
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,620
这就是为什么 你不应该去招惹犯罪团伙
Which is why you should never get involved in organized crime.

417
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,160
你觉得运动服在拍卖会上另有所图 
Do you think that the Tracksuits were after anything else at that auction?

418
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,040
我不知道 我只盯着杰克和阿曼德了
I don't know. I was pretty focused on Jack and Armand.

419
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,370
复仇者联盟基地的东西
It's pretty upsetting to think there might be stuff

420
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,910
这样漂在外面 还挺让人担心的
from the Avengers Compound floating around out there.

421
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,160
所以你仍然觉得杰克和这件事有关 
So, you still think Jack is involved somehow?

422
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,000
对 巧合也太多了
Yes. There's too many coincidences.

423
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,540
他那天晚上在拍卖会
He was at the auction that night,

424
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,500
昨天他给了我一块糖
and yesterday, he offered me a butterscotch.

425
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,250
这不算犯罪吧
Not exactly a crime.

426
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,580
我想刺他的脸 证明他在撒谎
When I tried to stab his face to prove he was lying,

427
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,120
他的格挡动作相当专业
he parried like a pro.

428
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,120
你要捅死你母亲的未婚夫 
You tried to stab your mom's fiancé?

429
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,700
而且 阿曼德死后 他是最大的受益人
Plus, he has everything to gain from Armand's death.

430
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,330
杰克的事有些蹊跷
The Jack thing, it's weird.

431
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
我明白 但是并没有真凭实据
I get it, but it's not exactly airtight.

432
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,410
对
Right.

433
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,330
所以我们需要找更多证据
Which is why we need more evidence.

434
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,370
所以咱们要溜进我妈的公寓
And why we're gonna sneak into my mom's penthouse.

435
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,500
等等 什么 
Wait, wait, wait, what?

436
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,040
我们可以去查她公司的文档
We can get into her company files.

437
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,660
毕肖普安保公司有个 规模巨大的罪犯数据库
Bishop Security has a huge criminal database.

438
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,700
肯定有运动服和杰克的信息
There's gotta be info on the Tracksuits and Jack in there.

439
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,290
好吧
Yeah.

440
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,370
你确定没人在家吗 
You're sure no one's home, right?

441
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,830
确定 别紧张
Yes. Relax.

442
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,540
来吧
Come on.

443
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,410
天啊 这是你们家 
Jeez, this is a home?

444
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,830
对 我的曾曾曾曾祖父 建造的这栋房子
Yeah. My, uh, great, great, great, great grandfather built the building.

445
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,160
我曾经试着从那个吊灯荡过来 把胳膊摔断了
I tried to swing from that very chandelier and broke my arm.

446
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,620
所以 对 我们家确实挺不一样的
So, uh, yeah, pretty impressive family, all the way around.

447
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,250
太厉害了
Impressive.

448
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,330
毕肖普安保公司 埃莉诺

449
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,500
通过家庭网络
So, from the home network,

450
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,620
我们应该可以用我母亲的密码 通过加密验证
we should be able to get past the encryption with my mom's password.

451
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,000
看来我入错行了
Yeah, I'm in the wrong business.

452
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,620
你说阿曼德是怎么死的 
How'd you say Armand was killed?

453
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,040
被剑捅死的
Stabbed with a sword.

454
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,700
看看有没有卡齐的信息
See if there's anything on Kazi.

455
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,830
好的 我看看
Okay. Let's see.

456
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,330
找到了
Here we go.

457
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,540
好吧 这是什么公司  斯隆有限公司 
Okay, what's this company, Sloan Limited?

458
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,950
卡齐是雇员之一 
Kazi is an employee?

459
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,370
等等 斯隆有限公司 有点耳熟
Wait, Sloan Limited, that sounds familiar.

460
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,910
你觉得有什么线索吗 
You think there's somethin' there?

461
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,910
我不知道
I don't know.

462
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,910
也许吧
Maybe.

463
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,910
我看看能不能查到杰克
Let me see what I can pull up on Jack.

464
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,200
该死
Crap.

465
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,790
现在有内置的硬件验证
Now there's an embedded hardware authentication.

466
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,910
我被强制退出了
And I've just been locked out.

467
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,370
你的账户已被停用

468
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
克林特 
Clint?

469
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,200
别动
Don't move.

470
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,250
根据漫威漫画改编

471
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,250
漫威影业出品
